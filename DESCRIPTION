Title: Time Series Segmentation for Longitudinal Data Analysis
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
    person("Dylan", "Pieper", , "dylanpieper@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Segment longitudinal data into meaningful episodes based on temporal
    gaps and variable changes. Designed for analyzing treatment patterns, patient
    journeys, and other time series data where interruptions and changes in
    covariates are significant. Functions support identifying discontinuities,
    tracking variable changes within episodes, and analyzing retention across
    specified time thresholds. Particularly useful for survival analyses and
    other time-varying statistical methods requiring structured temporal data.
